His methods are gruesome, to be sure, but there's something to be said about the lessons that he tries to impart on people.<br><br>I'll be updating this website as new developments are made public! In the meantime, I apologize if any part of the website seems unfinished. I'm new to coding, so please don't make fun of me :( </td>
